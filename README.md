# Position-Control-of-a-DC-Motor-Using-Feedback-Linearization-and-Extended-State-Observer
This project implements feedback linearization and a simple PID controller for precise position control of a brushed DC motor. Additionally, a LuGre-based observer is used to estimate and compensate for friction and external disturbances, enhancing control performance.
